# Login Page with Context API and Dark Mode to Light Mode Card Switcher with React Context APIs

This project combines two hands-on explorations of React Context APIs: creating a login page that utilizes context for managing user authentication and implementing a dark mode to light mode switcher for a card component.

## Description

React Context APIs offer a powerful tool for managing state across React components without the need for prop drilling. This project provides practical examples of how Context APIs can be leveraged to enhance user experience and streamline state management in React applications.

### Login Page with Context API

The first part of the project introduces a mini context API project: a login page that utilizes React Context for managing user authentication. This feature showcases how Context APIs can be applied to handle complex state management tasks, such as user login sessions, across multiple components within a React application.

### Dark Mode to Light Mode Card Switcher

The second part of the project focuses on implementing a dark mode to light mode switcher for a card component. By utilizing React Context APIs, the project demonstrates how to seamlessly toggle between different visual themes, offering users the flexibility to customize their viewing experience.

## Features

- **Login Page with Context API:**
  - Implements a login page with user authentication functionality.
  - Utilizes React Context for managing user login sessions and authentication state.
  - Demonstrates how Context APIs can simplify complex state management tasks within React applications.

- **Dark Mode to Light Mode Switcher:**
  - Implements a visually appealing toggle feature for switching between dark and light themes.
  - Utilizes React Context APIs for efficient state management across the application.
  - Enhances user experience by providing customizable viewing options.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Context API:** A feature in React for managing global state.
