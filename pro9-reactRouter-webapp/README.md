# Project Name

## Overview
This project is a frontend web application built using React.js. It serves as a single-page application (SPA) for [brief description of your project]. The application utilizes React Router for declarative routing, allowing seamless navigation between different pages without full page reloads.

## Technologies Used
- React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: Library for declarative routing in React applications.

## Components
1. **Header**: Renders the navigation bar for the application.
2. **Footer**: Displays the footer section.
3. **Home**: Renders the homepage UI.
4. **About**: Displays information about the project or organization.
5. **Contact Us**: Provides contact information or a form for user interaction.
6. **User**: Renders user-specific information based on the provided ID.
7. **GitHub**: Fetches and displays data from the GitHub API.

## React Router
- Routes are defined in the `main.jsx` file using `createBrowserRouter`, allowing for dynamic routing based on URL paths.
- Each route corresponds to a specific component, enabling efficient navigation within the SPA architecture.
- React Router functions used:
  - **createBrowserRouter**: Creates a browser router instance for defining routes in the application.
  - **useParams**: Extracts parameters from the URL in the `User` component, facilitating dynamic routing based on user ID.
  - **NavLink**: Programmatically navigates to different routes within components, enhancing user experience.
  - **Link**: Renders the child components of the matched route, facilitating nested routing structures.

## GitHub API Integration
- The `GitHub` component makes an API call to the GitHub API to fetch data such as followers count, following count, profile photo, and Twitter handle of the specified user.
- This data is then displayed in the UI to provide information about the user's GitHub profile.


## Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded asynchronously to improve initial loading time and performance.
- **React.memo**: Functional components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders, enhancing performance.
- **Functional Components**: Leveraging functional components over class components for better performance and code maintainability.

## ReactHooks
- **useEffect**: Used for performing side effects, such as data fetching, in functional components.
- **useState**: Manages component state within functional components, enabling dynamic updates to UI elements.
